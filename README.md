# Web-map-Taija-Huhtala

This is a web map of Tanzania Forest Reserves (data from the year 2020) and National Parks (data from the year 2016) created by Taija Huhtala.

You can find the map here:

Unfortunately, my browser was not able to show the map even when I tried everything I could. Therefore I did the changes to the code without the chance to see whether they worked or not. I was able to do the practicals 1 and 2 without such problems. The most important thing in my opinion is anyhow, that I learned to understand the basics
of data visualization and the different options different softwares have. Also, I learned to somewhat understand the code even though the final result has mistakes.
